            <p>Hello, My name is Jorge Barrientos. I am currently a student in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. Before I started this course I knew very little about writing code or how it worked to build the websites we use daily. I look forward to becoming a fully fledged web developer by the time this program comes to a finish.
            </p>
            
            <br><br>
            
            <p>
                Currently I work in Customer Service and hold a position as a Supervisor. This experience with handling customer issues and concerns translates into any work environment as there will always be an interaction between a consumer and a producer.
            
            </p>
            
            <br><br>

            <p>
                After my completion of the Coding Bootcamp, I will look to gain employment with a great team of fellow Web Developers in order to gain further knowledge from those more experienced than myself. Furthermore, I will look for the opportunity to grow with a small company and potentially start one of my own.
            </p>
